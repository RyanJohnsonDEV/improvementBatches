## App Description

This app was created for players of the game "osu!".

#### Game website: https://osu.ppy.sh/


This app was created with React.js, and is used to help players of this game improve by playing through sets of specific songs that I call "Batches". The app makes use of the Chimu API in order to get the details for each map, for example the song title, difficulty level, and download link. It will then map those details to each song in the list accordingly.

There is also a built-in option to mark each song as "Cleared" so the user knows which songs they still need to complete. This is saved in local storage, and then retrieved again when the list is loaded.
## Features

- Quick song download
- Intuitive design and navigation
- Set songs as "Completed"
- Responsive layout for mobile and PC
